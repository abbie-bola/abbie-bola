Currently in my early stages of exploring the world of Data Science, AI and ML;
working to achieve: 
- my childhood aspiration of contributing to bringing forth an era of highly advanced technology.
- my aspiration to have a career centred on building sustainable technologies, that encourage regenerative practices.

My vision for the future is an augmented world where technology is used to experience the world more fully & accessibly.

> Scroll down to view my projects & reading list <br>
> Pinned repositories are below this README section

My fascination for technology stemmed in my childhood, from watching & reading: <br>
- Sci-fi Media: Books and Movies -> Zenon (film series), Valerian & the City of a Thousand Planets, Ready Player One
- DC series (Young Justice)
  
I am excited to explore the possibilities of AI, and hope to soon be collaborating with fellow tech enthusiasts to optimise technologies to be as energy efficient as possible.

<b> 💎 In 2022, I and some friends launched GenZTechies: A community for African Teens in Tech. </b> <br>
Take a look at our <a href="https://genztechies.com/">website</a> to see what we have been up to in the last 3 years. 
You are very much welcome to join our community if you are a Black/African tech enthusiast! We love to support eachother on our tech-journeys, no matter the stage you're at: beginner to advanced :) <br>
> You can support us by sponsoring, partnering with us or simply just spreading the word about us, so more people can join the community & build connections with fellow techies 🎉
